# UltimateJS

## Project Goal
Next.js and After.js are great. Unfortunately our porject are driven on [redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux), [redial](https://github.com/lemonCMS/redial), [react-router-config](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-config), [react-loadable](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable)
and sass.

Both Next.js and After.js where atleast missing one or more of those components. Because After.js already implements react-router and is driven by 
[Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle) i choose this as a starting point to implement all i need for our projects.


## What can it do?
- Universal app
- Server side datafectching
- Waiting for all api data fecthed before inital render.
- Server side authorization check.
- Easy proxu implementation
- Webpack plugins thanks to razzle
- Highly customizable
